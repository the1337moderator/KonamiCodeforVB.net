==Konami Code for VB .net==
Custom Class for adding the Konami code.

When the specified key stroke pattern is entered in the proper order without interupting keystrokes, the checkkey function will return True.

If any incorrect key strokes are entered or the pattern is not complete, the checkkey function will return false


===How To Use===
To use create a new instance of the class under the class declartion of the windows form in which you want to use it:

'''vb.net
  Public Class Form1
    ' Create an instance of the class
    Private oKonami as new Konami
'''

Then under the Load event of the form, tell it to intercept key presses before the code is sent to the controls

'''vb.net
    Private Sub Form1_Load(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Me.Load
      ' This will intercept the key events on this form
      Me.KeyPreview = True  
    End Sub
'''

Finally send the pressed keys to check for the correct pattern

'''vb.net
  Private Sub Form1_KeyUp(sender As Object, e As KeyEventArgs) Handles Me.KeyUp
    ' Send the Key press on its way, and get some logic going
    If oKonami.checkKey(e.KeyCode) Then
      ' Congrats, pattern match
      MsgBox("Konami Code Entered")
    End If
  End Sub
'''

I have forked from there to provide a cleaner class file that can be implemented into any form.
